# BuildToolsWrapper


## Features

Build Tools wrapper is a simple wrapper script that provides a easy way to install and use BuildTools. it provides built in cacheing and support and allows you to easily choose your output directory etc.

## Why?
While the wrapper itself at the moment does not provide much, it is a good starting point for more features that are planned.

### What is planned?
* Support for downloading multiple spigot versions at once
* Support for downloading BungeeCord
* PaperMC and Waterfall support
